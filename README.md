# Lexia – Dyslexia Support Learning Application

# Introduction
Lexia is an interactive educational mobile application designed to support children with dyslexia in improving their reading, spelling, and comprehension skills. The system combines structured level-based progression, interactive mini-games, accessibility features, and parental monitoring tools to create a supportive and adaptive learning environment.

The application integrates rule-based word difficulty analysis and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extend learning beyond predefined content, enabling children to practice using real-world text in a structured way.

# The Problem
Children with dyslexia experience persistent difficulties in reading, spelling, and processing written language. These challenges often lead to slower academic progress, reduced confidence, and lower engagement in classroom activities.

Most existing digital solutions:

* Focus on isolated literacy skills

* Lack structured progression

* Provide limited adaptive feedback

* Do not integrate parental monitoring

* Require using multiple disconnected applications

As a result, learning becomes inconsistent, unstructured, and difficult to track over time.

There is a need for an integrated, structured, and engaging solution that supports both independent learning and parental involvement.

# The Solution
Lexia addresses these challenges through:

* Level-Based Learning System

Sequential progression ensures structured skill development.

* Interactive Mini-Games

Activities such as Word Matching and Letter Scramble reinforce vocabulary, spelling, and decoding skills.

* Guided Reading Module

Short stories with structured support improve fluency and comprehension.

* Accessibility Features

Dyslexia-friendly formatting (e.g., OpenDyslexic font) enhances readability.

* Parent Dashboard

Tracks progress and performance across all activities.

* OCR + Rule-Based Word Analysis

Real-world text can be scanned and analyzed. A custom rule-based system identifies difficult words to support targeted practice.

Lexia provides a comprehensive and structured digital environment that strengthens literacy skills while promoting confidence, independence, and long-term engagement.
